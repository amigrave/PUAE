PUAE
============
PUAE is merged from;
 E-UAE 0.8.29WIP4 (Richard Drummond, http://www.rcdrummond.net/uae/)
 WinUAE 1.6.10 (Toni Wilen, http://www.winuae.net)

 and they were based on;
 UAE (Bernd Schmidt, http://www.amigaemulator.org)

ROM
============
Note that to make full use of PUAE you will need access to an image
of some version of the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although PUAE does include
a ROM emulation which may work with some old games). The Amiga
Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted material and may not be freely
distributed (so don't ask me for a copy). If you don't have an Amiga
from which you can legally make a ROM image, a selection of ROM images
are available for purchase online from Cloanto (publishers of the
Amiga Forever distribution). See http://www.amigaforever.com/

Known problems
==============

Some significant misfeatures that I know about and am/will be working
to fix (eventually):

* Only platforms supporting the GTK+ toolkit have a useable
  configuration GUI (and the GTK+ GUI is still incomplete). However,
  Mac OS X users may like to try Daniel Pimley's graphical front-end,
  Hi Toro. See http://www.pimley.net/projects/.
* JIT direct memory access only works on Linux/x86 and, by default,
  you may only emulate up to 32MB of direct ZIII RAM; select more than
  that and the JIT will fall back on indirect memory access and hence
  will be slower. This is due to a system limit on the size of a POSIX
  shared memory segment. You can overcome this limit my modifying the
  value of the procfs setting, /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax.
* Virtual filesystem doesn't support platforms which use UTF-8 for
  filenames (e.g., OS X, Linux with a UTF-8 locale, etc.). Filenames
  with characters outside of the core ASCII range will be mangled.
* OpenGL renderer is experimental, unfinished and has no error
  recovery.
* Tear-free graphical output (with the gfx_vsync=true option) doesn't
  work on most platforms yet (the exceptions being Mac OS X with the
  SDL/GL renderer and AmigaOS4.0 with SDL).
* The Mac OS X version is currently for PowerPC hardware only.
  Users with Macintel hardware may wish to try
  Jens Weichert's Intel builds. See http://e-uae.de.vu/
