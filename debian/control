Description: Unix Amiga Emulator
 This is a fork of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an emulation core
 based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of the great features of WinUAE
 to non-Windows platforms. This version now finally has a name, E-UAE, since
 that's what everybody was calling it anyway. The 'E' can stand for anything
 you fancy. Experimental, extreme, exciting, egalitarian, eggplant, . . .
 .
 To make full use of E-UAE you will need access to an image of some version
 of the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although UAE does include a ROM emulation which
 may work with some old games). The Amiga Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted
 material and may not be freely distributed (so don't ask me for a copy).
