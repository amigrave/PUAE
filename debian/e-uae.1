.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBe-uae\fR is a fork of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an emulation
core based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of the great features of WinUAE
to non-Windows platforms. This version now finally has a name, E-UAE, since
that's what everybody was calling it anyway. The 'E' can stand for anything
you fancy. Experimental, extreme, exciting, egalitarian, eggplant, . . .
